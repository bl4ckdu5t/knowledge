# Morphing
Morphing is changing the coordinate values of a paths. Here are some examples:

# Misc
- Svg provides fallback for non supporting browsers with `switch` and `foreignObject`. [This tweet by Sara Soueidan for more](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/875112721922043904)

## Snippets
Using preserveAspectRatio:
```
preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" => background-size: contain
preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice" => background-size: cover
```
